I currently hold the position of Predoc in Economics at Columbia University, under the guidance of Professors Michael Carlos Best and Jack J. Wills. My primary research interests lie in the domains of public and development economics. Specifically, I seek to comprehend the behavior of firms in response to taxation, with a pronounced focus on informality as a prevalent reaction. Additionally, I investigate the dynamic consequences of size-based tax policies and the strategies employed by multinational corporations for profit shifting.

In my capacity as a Predoc, I am engaged in a myriad of projects. These include examining the intricacies of tax audits and understanding the detection and collection capabilities of developing nations. I employ Machine Learning and other advanced computational methods in efforts to predict poverty. Furthermore, I evaluate the ramifications of enhanced economic forecasting on individual decision-making, explore the challenges posed by information frictions in rural settings, and assess the potential and implications of emergent insurance technologies when scaled.

Before joining Columbia University, I completed my MSc in Economics at the University of Manchester. Earlier in my academic journey, I received a BS in Economics and Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore. I had the privilege of being National Outreach Program scholar at LUMS, a prestigious scholarship envisaged by Syed Babar Ali. 

On a personal note, my interests extend beyond economics and delve deep into the realms of mathematics and the rich tapestry of Punjabi language and culture. I hold a special reverence for the poetic genius of Bulleh Shah, whose verses resonate deeply with me. While I value the traditional essence of his poetry, I often find myself interpreting his words through a contemporary lens, drawing parallels with modern sensibilities and contexts.

I just wrote [this](https://bashirmohammad.github.io/RAGuide/intro.html) guide for how to do research in applied microeconomics with my amazing faculty mentor Michael Best and his PhD student Luigi Caloi. Comments and suggestions are most welcome and you can ask questions by opening an issue at the GitHub repository of this book.
