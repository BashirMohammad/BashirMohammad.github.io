I currently hold the position of Predoc in Economics at Columbia University, under the esteemed guidance of Professors Michael Carlos Best and Jack J. Wills. My primary research interests lie in the domains of public and development economics. Specifically, I seek to comprehend the behavior of firms in response to taxation, with a pronounced focus on informality as a prevalent reaction. Additionally, I investigate the dynamic consequences of size-based tax policies and the strategies employed by multinational corporations for profit shifting.

In my capacity as a Predoc, I am engaged in a myriad of projects. These include examining the intricacies of tax audits and understanding the detection and collection capabilities of developing nations. I employ Machine Learning and other advanced computational methods in efforts to predict poverty. Furthermore, I evaluate the ramifications of enhanced economic forecasting on individual decision-making, explore the challenges posed by information frictions in rural settings, and assess the potential and implications of emergent insurance technologies when scaled.

Before joining Columbia University, I completed my MSc in Economics at the University of Manchester. Earlier in my academic journey, I received a BS in Economics and Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore. I had the privilege of being National Outreach Program scholar at LUMS, a prestigious scholar envisaged by Syed Babar Ali. 

At at personal level, I am interested in mathematics, punjabi language and culture. My favourite poet is Bulleh Shah and I tend to interpret him in a very modern sense.
