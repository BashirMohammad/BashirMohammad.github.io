I am first year PhD Economics student at UC Berkeley. I am broadly interested in Public Economics, Macroeconomics and Industrial Organization. 
Earlier, I was [predoc](https://econ.columbia.edu/per/pre-doc-research-staff/pre-doc-alumni/) in Economics Department at Columbia University working for professors [Michael Carlos Best](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/mcb2270/) in Public Economics and [Jack J. Willis](https://sites.google.com/view/jwillis/) in Development Economics. 

I completed my MSc in Economics at the University of Manchester where I was advised by [Mazhar Waseem](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/mazhar.waseem).I received a BS in Economics and Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics at the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore. I had the privilege of being National Outreach Program scholar at LUMS, a prestigious scholarship envisaged by Syed Babar Ali. 

On a personal note, my interests extend beyond economics and delve deep into the realms of mathematics and the rich tapestry of Punjabi language and culture. I hold a special reverence for the poetic genius of Bulleh Shah, whose verses resonate deeply with me. While I value the traditional essence of his poetry, I often find myself interpreting his words through a contemporary lens, drawing parallels with modern sensibilities and contexts.
